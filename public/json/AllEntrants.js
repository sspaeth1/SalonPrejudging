      "This illustration is intended to provide neuroscience students an overview of specialized brain cells called microglia, by distilling complex, growing research into a concise and memorable poster. A defining characteristic of microglia is their ability to transform dramatically and take on different shapes and functions to monitor the neuronal environment and respond quickly to problems. Two main states are depicted in this illustration: a highly-branched “surveying” form, and an “active” phagocytic form. The lower right inset presents an example of an important molecular interaction thought to regulate this microglial activity, between ATP released from damaged neurons and purinergic receptors (trimeric ion channels). In the background, a capillary of the blood-brain barrier enveloped by astrocytic foot processes provides environmental context and a sense of scale. 3D models used: PDB IDs 4DW1, 4DW0; PubChem CID 5957.",

By using color coding and increasing levels of magnification, the first figure in the set demonstrates how the anatomy relates to hearing loss in adults (outer ear and inner ear). The second part of the figure builds on the first, using palette and views to demonstrate the components, mechanism, and placement of the cochlear implant. By using multiple views and magnifications, the reader gets a good spatial sense of the path that the implant electrode takes from implanted receive–stimulator to within the spiral of the cochlea.",

This scale illustration depicts the BBB environment, fluorescent markers, therapeutic methods, and drugs. The BBB environment with glycocalyx, basement membrane, pericytes, and astrocyte end-foot processes are in microns while the molecules in the right inset are in nanometers. The left inset is not to scale to enable comparison between the competent and disrupted tight-junction.

Consequently, the bony anatomy has been omitted.

Surgeons locate the IMax by palpating the posterior wall of the maxilla and sliding their finger caudally into the PMF, located just medial to the lateral pterygoid muscle. Next, the lateral pterygoid muscle is transected to gain appropriate exposure for the required length of the pterygoid segment. The IMax is dissected to a sufficient length and then the proximal-donor segment is immobilized superiorly. This allows for anastomosis with the interposition graft.

One of the dangers of this kind of double bypass is prolonged ischemia during multiple periods of temporary occlusion. These figures illustrate a method that can mitigate those ischemic dangers. In this example, once the M2 inferior trunk is occluded distal to the aneurysm, it is revascularized via a bypass from adjacent circulation. The proximal segment of the artery between the distal trapping clip and the anastomosis is a dead end (B). This segment was repurposed as a live end (C) that can then be joined with the M2 superior trunk while the M2 inferior trunk territory distal to the temporary clip remains fully vascularized. This allows an anastomosis between the superior and inferior vessels (either end-to-side or end-to-end) while ensuring only one trunk’s territory is occluded at any one time.",

The challenge was to show the embryo and placental structures in true anatomical form, but utilize a soft, subtle presentation so as not to intimidate the expectant parents. Fetal color differentiation was tricky, as the skin is translucent early on, and the skin pigment cells won’t become active until ~week 26.

      "The illustrations were commissioned to visually explain the anatomic basis for a novel endoscopic endonasal treatment of maxillary nerve (V2) neuralgia. Left side cross-section view depicts the nerve as it courses through the roof of the maxillary sinus and its relation to branches of the maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa. Right side ghosted view shows the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve with V2 (green) as it emerges from the foramen rotundum and continues as the infraorbital nerve (ION). The surgeon's visualization and understanding of the close proximity of the V2 root behind the maxillary sinus wall is key to this minimally invasive surgery. Endoscopic views show the maxillary antrostomy and exposure of the sphenopalatine artery (SPA) and posterior nasal artery (PNA) landmarks for the bony removal (dashed line) of the posterior maxillary wall. Transection of V2 nerve is made posterior to the infraorbital artery, which makes a characteristic loop over the nerve.",

Convergent evolution is the idea that animals living in similar habitats on different islands independently evolved similar appearance and behavior. A large full color drawing of an anole anchors the composition and signals the subject matter. It's an entry point and its shape guides the eye through the infographic. After presenting a map of the area of study, four different habitats are color-keyed. These habitats are present on each of the islands shown in the map. This coloration is carried through examples of limb length and toepad size. Lastly, a graphic showing the link between habitat brightness and dewlap brightness illustrates that evolution favors heightened contrast for visibility.",

RNA oligonucleotide tags bind to all cells, with variances based on genetic identity. Using a tiny network of mirrors beneath the cancer slide, a researcher can choose to reflect light only on a particular morphological type of tissue. The tumor cells of interest are illuminated like city lights, encouraging a visiting spaceship to explore their planet. The light-activated RNA oligos are then cleaved from the bright tumor cells of interest and are vacuumed into a pipette tip (seen at edges) as though they are bemused cattle ready to be studied. The greatest challenge here was developing an eye-catching presentation that allows researchers who regularly view tumor stains to see their samples in a new “light,” increasing their interest in this new technology. The otherworldly technique ultimately gives the researcher bi-fold information, both morphological and genetic in nature.",

The Black patient’s wrist band is color coordinated with the Kapan Meier survival curve with the lower survival events while the White patient’s wrist band matches the color of the higher survival events.

From being capable of seeing and recording only a few cells in a region, we can now utilize 3D electron microscopy and AI-based image analysis to reconstruct all of them. To contextualize this present work, I have shown a few sparse cells in Cajal-style ink transitioning into the densely packed block of neurons that the authors of this paper were able to visualize.

To achieve scientifically-accurate, full-length protein structures and represent their dynamics, we have combined recently-published SARS CoV-2 data with relevant data sets from other betacoronaviruses and viral families that share similar membrane fusion mechanisms (i.e. Influenza and HIV among others).

This animation had dual challenges of visualizing (i) the sarcomere--the complex molecular machine that is the basic unit of muscle contractility--and (ii) the complex steps of the actin-myosin crossbridge cycle. Both are based on data and literature review, with the conscious design decision to reduce the scale of the sarcomere and to slow its action from realtime to allow viewers to have clear views of sarcomere function.

We developed an anatomically accurate 3D model of the heart, sectioned in two planes to show the complex spatial relationship between the left atrium and vulnerable tissues (esophagus, phrenic nerve). The heart was given a simplified look to draw focus to the device and its function. Using 3D data, we created the first visual representation of the FARAWAVE electric field, which is transient and invisible to the naked eye, providing our client with an invaluable tool for demonstrating the device's unique functionality.",

      "This piece illustrates the pathogenesis of acute cellular rejection of a kidney transplant. Organ rejection is highly common and happens when the recipient’s immune system recognizes the organ as foreign. It occurs due to differences in HLA alleles, which encode surface proteins on the organ's cells. This mismatch triggers the host's immune system to recruit myriad immune cells, which attack the organ. This piece is meant to educate a general audience who is interested in learning more about organ rejection.",

Psychoeducation and therapy often includes some basic neuroanatomy. However, the visuospatial learning component of neuroanatomy is often challenging to understand. The goal of this comic is to provide a fun and memorable visual metaphor (using Dr. Daniel Siegel’s hand-model of the brain) to explain our basic neuroanatomy and how it can relate to our very human experiences of hypervigilance.",

To accomplish this, individual stages of disease progression were illustrated in chronological order along a graphic representation of the myometrium. Each stage of disease progression along the myometrium corresponded to illustrations at the tissue and cellular level. Negative space played a crucial role in creating both separation and grouping of different disease stages and in developing a logical reading order that naturally guides the audience. Secondary design variables, including leader lines, were used to link illustrations with text for clarity.",

      "Celiac disease (CD) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease triggered by gluten ingestion. 95% of patients with CD carry HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-DQ2, and 5% carry HLA-DA8. Ingested gluten is broken down into glutenin and gliadin, and gliadin is subsequently deamidated by tissue transglutaminase. Deamidation involves the conversion of a glutamine residue to glutamate within the antigenic region of gliadin. This results in high affinity binding of gliadin to a HLA-DQ2-8 complex. An antigen presenting cell with bound gliadin is then recognized by a CD4+ T-cell, and an immune reaction follows.  The purpose of this piece was to visualize the HLA-gliadin-T-cell complex and its crucial role in CD using novel structural data published 2019. Compositional studies and several phases of sketches refined the story to highlight the key molecular events in CD: gliadin deamidation and antigen presentation to a CD4+ T-cell.",

The brochure intends to educate patients on the parts and functionality of pacemakers to better understand their treatment journey. The brochure begins by providing a brief overview of a heart's natural rhythm and potential changes in rhythm. It is assumed that the patient has been diagnosed, and their care provider has already explained their heart's pathology. Following the overview of the heart's rhythm, the brochure opens to visualize the pacemaker and discusses the major parts and functions of the device. Finally, because the pacemaker depicted is unbranded, the brochure may act as a proof of concept for potential clients in the medical device sector.",

      "Medulloblastoma, a highly invasive tumour of the cerebellum, has one of the highest mortality rates of pediatric cancers. Metastatic cells are the leading cause of treatment failure and death in medulloblastoma patients. For over a century, scientists assumed that medulloblastoma metastases travel exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid; however, novel research shows that medulloblastoma can spread through the circulatory system as well. This new mechanism presents the first biological target for metastases; therefore, the dissemination of this research is critical to the development of therapies, disease management, and prognosis. An educational 3D animation can effectively disseminate this research, as well as increase awareness and interest in medulloblastoma. A story-driven narrative and emphasis on the use of visual metaphor will put the research in context by establishing why this research matters, what the future implications are, and how it is relevant to the audience.",
