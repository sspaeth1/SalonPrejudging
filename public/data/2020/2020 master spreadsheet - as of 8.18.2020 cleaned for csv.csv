A defining characteristic of microglia is their ability to transform dramatically and take on different shapes and functions to monitor the neuronal environment and respond quickly to problems. Two main states are depicted in this illustration: a highly-branched “surveying” form, and an “active” phagocytic form. The lower right inset presents an example of an important molecular interaction thought to regulate this microglial activity, between ATP released from damaged neurons and purinergic receptors (trimeric ion channels). In the background, a capillary of the blood-brain barrier enveloped by astrocytic foot processes provides environmental context and a sense of scale. 3D models used: PDB IDs 4DW1, 4DW0; PubChem CID 5957."

At times, the inner ear and middle ear are depicted significantly larger than the actual relationship to the external ear (auricle). The intended purpose of this illustration was to show all the components of middle and inner ear anatomy as they relate to cochlear implantation using an accurate scale relationship. By using color coding and increasing levels of magnification, the first figure in the set demonstrates how the anatomy relates to hearing loss in adults (outer ear and inner ear). The second part of the figure builds on the first, using palette and views to demonstrate the components, mechanism, and placement of the cochlear implant. By using multiple views and magnifications, the reader gets a good spatial sense of the path that the implant electrode takes from implanted receive–stimulator to within the spiral of the cochlea."

This illustration provides an anatomical guide for students while they dissect the thoracic vertebrae in the posterior mediastinum. During this dissection, students are asked to identify the thoracic sympathetic chain, its ganglia, and the communicating rami. This area of the body is usually difficult to dissect, due to the small size and delicate nature of the nerves. This illustration shows the orientation in an upright position as opposed to a prone position (like the donor) because the faculty member wants the students to begin to think in ‘anatomical position.’ The illustration was done in line to cut back on color printing costs."

At this stage of their education, students are not required to memorize each liver segment or venous branch, but must have a general understanding of these concepts. While this illustration shows the most common branching pattern within the segments, students must remember that liver anatomy is highly variable and is usually unique to an individual."

It prints clearly in B&W and at a small size to accommodate clinic facilities. Some anatomical features have been omitted because they do not help the patient orient to their own anatomy—e.g., patients may find the clitoris to be a better landmark for orientation than the pubic symphysis, which is entirely internal and may not be easily recognizable to an average patient. Consequently, the bony anatomy has been omitted. Medical terms were used in labels to encourage the patient to become familiar with these terms, but “Labia minora” has been further described in the caption as a “fold of skin”."

Surgeons locate the IMax by palpating the posterior wall of the maxilla and sliding their finger caudally into the PMF, located just medial to the lateral pterygoid muscle. Next, the lateral pterygoid muscle is transected to gain appropriate exposure for the required length of the pterygoid segment. The IMax is dissected to a sufficient length and then the proximal-donor segment is immobilized superiorly. This allows for anastomosis with the interposition graft.

One of the dangers of this kind of double bypass is prolonged ischemia during multiple periods of temporary occlusion. These figures illustrate a method that can mitigate those ischemic dangers. In this example, once the M2 inferior trunk is occluded distal to the aneurysm, it is revascularized via a bypass from adjacent circulation. The proximal segment of the artery between the distal trapping clip and the anastomosis is a dead end (B). This segment was repurposed as a live end (C) that can then be joined with the M2 superior trunk while the M2 inferior trunk territory distal to the temporary clip remains fully vascularized. This allows an anastomosis between the superior and inferior vessels (either end-to-side or end-to-end) while ensuring only one trunk’s territory is occluded at any one time."

RNA oligonucleotide tags bind to all cells, with variances based on genetic identity. Using a tiny network of mirrors beneath the cancer slide, a researcher can choose to reflect light only on a particular morphological type of tissue. The tumor cells of interest are illuminated like city lights, encouraging a visiting spaceship to explore their planet. The light-activated RNA oligos are then cleaved from the bright tumor cells of interest and are vacuumed into a pipette tip (seen at edges) as though they are bemused cattle ready to be studied. The greatest challenge here was developing an eye-catching presentation that allows researchers who regularly view tumor stains to see their samples in a new “light,” increasing their interest in this new technology. The otherworldly technique ultimately gives the researcher bi-fold information, both morphological and genetic in nature."

"The poster describes how a malaria infected mosquito injects sporozoites into the bloodstream of a mammalian host and how this leads to maturation of the parasite. The schematic diagram follows the sporozoites as they enable the formation of schizonts and eventually merozoites. Merozoites infect red blood cells and these blood cells either become new schizonts or differentiate into gametocytes. Gametocytes circulate through the bloodstream until they infect a new mosquito as it feeds on the infected host.""",Jennifer Zernick,,,,,,,,,,

Ingested gluten is broken down into glutenin and gliadin, and gliadin is subsequently deamidated by tissue transglutaminase. Deamidation involves the conversion of a glutamine residue to glutamate within the antigenic region of gliadin. This results in high affinity binding of gliadin to a HLA-DQ2-8 complex. An antigen presenting cell with bound gliadin is then recognized by a CD4+ T-cell, and an immune reaction follows.  The purpose of this piece was to visualize the HLA-gliadin-T-cell complex and its crucial role in CD using novel structural data published 2019.

Sarah,McGuinness,smcgui5@uic.edu,L,L-008 Electric Biofilms,L. Animation,L-008,Electric Biofilms,"3DS Max, Adobe After Effects",.mp4,Research scientists in STEM,"In the world of STEM research, principal investigators find themselves struggling to communicate the intricacies of their research to others. Interdisciplinary communication is essential for groundbreaking scientific discoveries. This animation seeks to introduce Dr. Arthur Prindle's research on electrochemical bacterial signaling, or neuron-like electrical impulses which allow bacterial biofilms to organize and communicate. This novel discovery is of great importance for understanding bacterial biofilms and thus developing reliable treatments for biofilm-related infections. Because the intricacies and impact of Dr. Prindle's research reach as far as molecular biology, microbiology, neuroscience, and public health, a concise and aesthetically pleasing animation is a wonderfully efficient tool to bring those from a variety of STEM backgrounds up to speed, to hopefully encourage future multidisciplinary collaboration."

Animation,L-009,The Red Pulp of the Spleen,"Maxon C4D, Pixologic ZBrush, Adobe After Effects",Animation video,Undergraduate biology students,"This animation educates the viewer on the complex anatomy of the spleen and its role in blood filtration.  The animation first introduces the general anatomy of the spleen and focuses on the structure and function of the red pulp. After briefly depicting the structure of venous sinuses, it progresses to the pathway of red blood cells (RBCs) through open and closed circulation. The different fates of healthy and old RBCs are highlighted, followed by the role of macrophages in blood filtration."
To most clearly describe the venous sinuses, most of the reticular fibers surrounding the area were purposefully omitted to obtain a clear visual field. The density of red blood cells and leukocytes within the splenic cords was also attenuated to bring more focus to the blood flowing in the vessels. Few 3D-visualizations of the spleen are easily available," and this animation helps fill the information gap for an organ that many students find confusing.""",Susie Yun,,,,,,,,

Animation,L-010,Preoperative Anemia Patient Education: A Character Driven Story,After Effects/Maya,1080p Video,General public,"Preoperative anemia is a common condition that leads to worse patient outcomes, including morbidity and mortality. Patient blood management (PBM) is a multidisciplinary program developed to address preoperative anemia. Although PBM is proven to be effective, most patients are unaware of its existence. This animation aims to 1) educate all preoperative patients on the risk of anemia, and 2) to improve awareness of PBM using character-driven stories, which similar patient-education projects tend to neglect. Our challenge was to craft an engaging health journey that blends 2D and 3D assets seamlessly, while explaining the key concepts with minimal texts to make the animation content more accessible and inclusive. A thorough review of the transfusion literature and content-expert interviews also informed the script and character design, so that the animation accurately reflects the diverse cultural and pathological background of those affected by preoperative anemia."

TTTS is treated using fetoscopic laser ablation; however, this complex procedure is only performed at specialized surgical centres and requires significant training complicated by infrequent cases, a steep learning curve, and the need to prioritize patient safety. Twin-Twin Training Simulator is a digital tool designed to simplify TTTS training by teaching requisite anatomical and procedural skills. Users can explore the uterine environment, inspect the placental surface, identify target anastomotic vessels, and practice performing laser ablations. The simulation uses real-time visual feedback to indicate user performance and features controls to modify and simulate the surgical environment. Designed for use in different learning contexts, the simulator can be used with a mouse and keyboard, as well as a prototype motion controller that mimics an operative fetoscope."

These include the weakness of a paper-based dissection manual that included only grayscale illustrations and instructions written only in text, as well as the difficulty that students were having when trying to understand the structural relationships between species. Features of ILLIAD that address these points include videos of the dissection process and the accompanying diagrams, a homology page to enable students to explore similar structures across species, and a quiz section within each module that simulate bell-ringer exams that students would encounter during the course. Multimedia learning has been proven to be beneficial to student learning, therefore we hope ILLIAD can help students overcome the current challenges they face within the course and enhance their overall learning experience."
