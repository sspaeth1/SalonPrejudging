The loss of elasticity of the CPM following radiation treatment causes the lubricant applied to the bougie to accumulate proximal to the muscle and blood caused by disruption of the esophageal mucosal to remain distal to it. To maintain mucosal integrity in the vicinity of the upper esophageal sphincter when passing the bougies the practitioner should administer a water soluble lubricant through a rigid esophagoscope proximal and distal to the CPM at the outset of the procedure. Application of lubricant to the cervical esophagus as the esophagoscope is being withdrawn can reduce mucosal damage during subsequent bougie dilation.",

      "Often times it is a challenge in basic research to describe the abstract associations in a process because the research findings are novel and are normally not visual. In order to create a single image that concisely summarized the findings, I chose a highly rendered style to see both the vector and the micro-environment of the bite site. This image describes cellular and chemical changes at the bite site during blood feeding by the 'Aedes aegypti' mosquito. Depicted is the mosquito's six-part proboscis including two parallel tubes- the hypopharynx which sends saliva down into the bite site and the labrum which sucks blood and a small amount of saliva up. Mosquito bites induce mast cell degranulation and secretion of 5HT, CysLT and ADP. Mosquito saliva contains pharmacologically active substances that prevent blood vessels from constricting, stop blood from clotting, inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent inflammation.",

However, visual evidence too often captures not the interaction, but the aftermath, particularly in soft-bodied taxa. Without these snapshots, we are left to rely on sedimentary trace fossil records. These burrows provide glimpses into the hunting behavior of the predator. This Cambrian era study looked at data from burrow intersections of trilobites and their vermiform prey to quantitatively determine what amount of trace fossils record an intentional interaction. It was determined that trilobite traces appear to intersect vermiform burrows far more than what would be expected by random chance alone. Once this was established, the next challenge was to determine a preferred angle of attack. It was found that indeed, low angle attacks seemed to be the preferred orientation.",

A 7-mm diameter socket was then drilled into the proximal humerus and the tendon was inserted using a tension-slide technique. In one limb, OsteoCrete was injected into the socket before final tensioning of the suspensory button. In the other limb, a 7-mm interference screw was inserted after the button was tensioned.\r\nIt was concluded that OsteoCrete significantly improved fixation, particularly in low quality bone.",

When critical aortic stenosis is present in a second trimester fetus, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and weak. As a result, there is less blood flow through the left side of the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to stop growing, leading to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Through fetal treatment of the critical aortic stenosis, doctors hope to prevent the formation of HLHS.\r\n\r\nPediatrics Nationwide magazine is a channel for knowledge exchange among pediatric clinicians and researchers and gives an overview of new pediatric surgical techniques and new research.",

Bypass surgery demonstrates that open microsurgery will continue to evolve. By rearranging and combining preexisting bypass techniques, Michael Lawton, MD has developed a new series of 'fourth generation' bypass methodology for treating these complex vascular pathologies. This illustration depicts these new techniques: type 4A bypasses use in situ (or intraluminal) suturing within the conventional anastomosis, whereas type 4B bypasses maintain the basic construct of reimplantations or reanastomoses but use an unconventional anastomosis. Dexterity and meticulous application of these new, innovative microsurgical techniques will be a tremendous asset to every open vascular neurosurgeon.",

Controversies in Skull Base Surgery seeks to provide answers to that question by weighing the pros and cons of three surgical treatment options: transnasal endoscopy, open surgery, and radiosurgery/gamma knife. By focusing on management strategy of these three surgical options, the textbook clarifies areas of controversy that will help neurosurgeons make correct decisions to positively impact patients' quality of life and recovery.",

Curvatures of 500 or more typically require surgery. Straightening of the spine is done by installing various systems of pedicle screws, connectors and rods on the spine.\r\nCustom 3D models of the spine were sculpted. The posterior skeletal image shows typical scoliosis bend; allowing viewers to quickly identify condition. Background images show different levels of curvature & highlight importance of degree of curvature in treatment. Lack of color helps set the stage for the main surgical image highlighting client's hardware. \r\nMain image showcases one techniques used to straighten a bend & features black towers & cross brackets used to surgically bring spine back into alignment so that pedicle screws, connectors, lock screws & rods can be permanently placed to hold the spine in place.",

However, one desirable benefit of having an onscreen host is the reduction in visual assets needed to keep a video interesting. The development of a template and animated onscreen host was then introduced as a balance.

The first segment of the video introduces the audience to the overall question: 'what is a convolutional neural network and how does it work?'. Next, in an analogy, which is not included in this cut, we use letters instead of pixels to highlight how computers will search for simple elements (letters) in something complicated (a body of text) for specific details (a word or phrase). We help conceptualize how these layers of simple elements are stacked and scanned for interpretation by a CNN.

By combining BV with Nivo, the immune system is targeted from multiple angles, potentially improving antitumor immune responses. Challenges included that BV and Nivo act on different immune pathways, which are separated spatially and temporally within the body. We used a generic 'liquid' environment to represent both the lymphatics system and bloodstream, and focused the narrative on T-cells'a key player in both mechanisms of action'in order to tie together the two mechanisms into a cohesive, linear story. Accurate 3D representations of proteins were created using PDB data, and the color palette was inspired by histology staining methods.",

The animation demonstrates the effects of the disease on central vision and its impact on quality of life. It also explains the complex cellular anatomy of the retina and how inflammation in the VEGF pathway can lead to neovascularization. This gives context to the other installations within the booth, tying the anatomical and patient empathy experiences to the VEGF pathway targeted by new and current treatments.",

The goal of this animation was to show ' in a visually dynamic way ' the more recently-developed cell-based coagulation model. Detailed cellular and molecular modeling, dynamic animated motion and subtle visual effects are used to immerse the viewer in a simplified depiction of a complex biochemical process. A muted color palette is incorporated that conforms to branding standards and avoids a 'textbook-like' diagrammatic appearance, but still allows viewers to readily distinguish between characters. A collapsing guide along the side provides orientation to appreciate what stage of the process is being depicted.",

      "Our client sought the development of an unbranded 3D animation to explain immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) with respect to the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). The animation is for use by medical science liaisons to help educate healthcare professionals and aims to position their company as a leader in MS research. This is achieved through a script using a series of highly-focused vignettes that discuss key ideas as they pertain to disease burden, pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies. Visually, the animation utilizes imagery that complements this style of vignette storytelling, while being mindful of the sensitive nature of the topic. Demyelination, a key event in MS, is echoed throughout the video through various imagery. It is suggested through the stylized ink transitions as well as the pyramid comparison charts, to create a strong, cohesive and visually engaging piece.",

The CT scans were exported from a DICOM viewer in a fashion that created surface renderings of the bone, screws, and spacers.  Due to artifacts on the CT, and the low resolution of the CT scan, the surface renderings are not geometrically perfect shapes, but they give a 100% accurate representation of what is visible on the CT and how everything is positioned.  The final video was used by medical experts during trial to talk about how the spacers will migrate over time and how the screws affect the adjacent nerves to the legs.",

This animation was created to combat a defense radiologist's opinion (that free fluid/air amounts were small & unconcerning in a post-laparoscopy patient) by summarizing the free fluid/air in one 3D image.  ID and isolation of free fluid/air from each CT slice were performed, followed by reconstruction into a 3D image.  Tissues were selectively cut away or assigned varying opacities to allow optimum visualization.  Some of the most impressive scan slices float out of the 3D image to further demonstrate the free air/fluid was clearly visible.  Labels and illustrations appear over the slices so decision makers could see what a radiologist should see when viewing the slices.",

To maximize accessibility, the card game can be printed at home or school and a 3D printable version is available for low-sighted users. In the game, players collect bacteria samples from card hands and grow bacteria in card petri dishes. Game mechanisms illustrate biological concepts, e.g. a DNA change card deck illustrates the randomness of mutations, and that mutations can be helpful, neutral, or detrimental to organisms. Antibiotic cards can kill bacteria, but sometimes multiple rounds are needed. Additionally, if a bacteria in the game is not cleared, it may eventually develop antibiotic resistance. The 3D print version has the same functionality. This game was created as a prototype to suggest how NIH could expand its reach and is also an exploration of accessible design. A card game was chosen to encourage interactive learning, as well as for its accessibility possibilities.",

This poster highlights the specific residues that are important in the pharmacology of GLP-1R, and are essential in understanding how to create novel therapeutics. Residues D372 and E373 found in extracellular loop 3 may contribute to biased agonism in which individual ligands acting at the same GPCR can elicit distinct profiles of signaling and regulation. It has been shown that mutation of these 2 residues highlighted substantially reduces GLP-1 affinity and signaling but has little effect on Exendin function. The visuals present an overall representation of GLP-1R and bound ligand Exendin, as well as a closer view of extracellular loop 3 and its key residues.",

Intracellular levels of calcium can be detected by calcium-sensing proteins such as calmodulin, which then activate various target proteins leading to downstream biological effects. I created this two-page spread for a popular science magazine in order to illustrate the relationship between the structure and function of calmodulin in calcium signaling. In order to achieve this goal, I used: (i) 3D molecular models to depict the conformational changes of calmodulin upon binding to calcium ions; and (ii) schematic diagrams to communicate the versatility of calmodulin in binding to different target proteins and activating a wide range of functions in the human body. In addition, I employed color-coding, labels, and visual metaphors to further enhance the information being conveyed.",

The AgoPAM and full agonist AP8 binds to this novel pocket, helping activate GPR40. The binding of partial agonist MK-8666 (to a different site) also helps regulate GPR40 activation to a lesser extent. These two ligands allosterically regulate GPR40 activation, with full agonist AP8 being the stronger driver of activation. Surface representations of GPR40 and the membrane and CPK representations of the ligands were used to show the spatial relationships between the binding pocket, ligands, and membrane. The insets show the binding mechanism of AP8. When AP8 binds to the AgoPAM site, a conformational change in ICL2 occurs, facilitating a number of interactions between AP8 and residues that situate AP8 in the binding pocket. A ribbon representation was used to simplify the receptor and place focus on the binding residues and AP8 in these insets.",

      "Scientists have recently decoded the genome of the great white shark, unlocking mysteries about these feared and misunderstood predators. Understanding the genome has allowed scientists to dive deeper into the sharks' genetic makeup revealing genes associated with DNA repair, DNA damage response and DNA damage tolerance. In contrast, humans are impacted by genome instability from accumulation of damaged DNA, creating vulnerability to cancers and age-related diseases. Discovery of these shark genes could benefit human genetic research.\r\n\r\nThis conceptual image plays on 'unlocking the code,' of the A-T-C-G combination, which represents the genome being unlocked by scientists.  The underwater scene with a lurking great white shark suggests fear of these misunderstood predators.  Gel electrophoresis bands create the background water pattern.   The illustration is mocked-up as the cover of the journal Nature.",

The aim of this project was to create a journal cover to engage a scientifically-interested lay audience and introduce them to this topic. The second aim of this project was to explore techniques in 3D sculpting, lighting, composition, and 3D modelling. To achieve the main communication goal, it was important to convey the message in a simple, but memorable way. A heart was sculpted and platformed on top of the scaffolds seen in traditional 3D printing in order to bridge these concepts together. Dramatic lighting was then utilized to bring focus towards the heart and the printer needle. The heart was 3D modelled in Maya, and the details were sculpted in Zbrush. Final renders were completed in Maya and the final composition completed in Photoshop.",

    intended_purpose:
      "This animation aims to communicate the risk of HIV transmission via breastfeeding to mothers living with HIV in Canada. Knowledge of mother-to-child transmission is poor, and the cultural pressure to breastfeed has complex implications. It was essential that the science of transmission risk be conveyed in a clear and culturally sensitive manner, to help women to make informed decisions about breastfeeding. All materials were presented for feedback to members of the target audience, healthcare providers, and representatives from Canadian HIV organizations in an iterative design process. This helped us develop an animation with diverse characters, culturally sensitive metaphors, and nuanced descriptions of risk. The animation explains HIV transmission on a cellular level, and risks that are breastfeeding-specific. It has been made available online via the Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN), and was introduced through workshops in partnership with the Women & HIV/AIDs Initiative (WHAI).",

    primaryAudience:
      "Autopsy assistants, Neuropathology and Pathology residents and fellows",
    intended_purpose:
      "Training in autopsy brain removal is challenging because: 1) the number of hospital autopsies have declined, 2) incorrect cutting planes and depth of cut during opening of the cranium can lead to inadequate exposure of, or damage to the brain, 3) initial hesitation to perform the procedure due to proximity to the face, and 4) current teaching tools are limited to drawings and photographs; no physical practice of the procedure is involved. To address this deficit, a virtual reality (VR) simulation was created to teach proper methodology in performing steps of the autopsy brain removal. The simulation provides an immersive VR interactive experience using realistic virtual patient models, sound effects, and haptic responses within a VR autopsy suite, exposing trainees to an autopsy suite environment. It also features real-time visual feedback and evaluation of user performance to assist in improvement of skills and knowledge during the step of opening the cranium with an oscillating saw.",

Game play focuses on resource management, where the player has to feed their queen, and themselves, in order to dig out a home, defend the tree, and add more ants to the colony. The first level focuses only on digging and feeding the queen so the player can the controls and how to use their nectar supplies at an easier pace. The next level adds bacteria and the game's win state of growing the colony, using the new collectable of protein bodies. By engaging the player and adding stakes to these overlapping tasks, they gain an understanding of the specific benefits these ants provide the tree and vice versa, which can be applied to a greater appreciation of how organisms interact with each other in nature.",

    primaryAudience: "College Students",
    intended_purpose:
      "This game teaches the audience the basic functions of red blood cells and hemoglobin, by playing as a red blood cell traveling through blood vessels and deliver oxygen to the heart within a time limit. Before reaching the heart, the player must avoid the carbon dioxide in the blood, as it will be attracted to them, and if it hits, will cause them to lose an oxygen. This mechanic mirrors the concept of hemoglobin's use in respiration, since it can both bind to oxygen and carbon dioxide. As a player loses oxygen, carbon dioxide from further away will be attracted to their red blood cell, teaching the concept that as hemoglobin binds more carbon dioxide, other carbon dioxide binds with it more easily. Once reaching the the heart, players must purposefully release oxygen to beat the level. User interface (UI) elements are used to reinforce understanding the basic structure of hemoglobin, by using a stylized Hb as one of the indicators for how many molecules of oxygen the player has left.",

Kinundrum, a combination of the words 'kinesiology' and 'conundrum', guides students through lower limb biomechanics case studies at increasing levels of difficulty. Case studies present animated injury scenarios, after which students solve interactive problems accompanied by 3D models, animations, and illustrations of the affected anatomy. Kinundrum combines problem-based learning pedagogy with multimedia design and web technology to create an interactive learning tool. Kinundrum marks the first time a collaborative MRP has been developed at BMC, which meant the project was not only more ambitious in scope, but also developed project management, task-tracking, and teamwork skills.",

Cell Explorer is an interactive virtual reality game built for the HTC Vive that aims to mitigate cognitive overload and evoke wonder by creating an accurate cellular 'world.' The objective of this game is to create a protein by moving through and interacting with the cell's organelles, encouraging the user to learn spatial relationships. Each organelle is visually stunning and color coded to keep the users' attention and help information retention. The user physically performs actions that the corresponding cellular components would mechanically perform. This kinetic learning reinforces written information nested in the game and concepts taught in the classroom.",
